# Robot Program Handler

## Purpose
The Robot Program Handler can be used for the external exchange of robot programs (KUKA). 
The control takes place via Orion Context Broker (OCB).

### Features
  - robot program transfer due to OCB request from file server to robot
  - robot program transfer due to OCB request from robot to file server
  - robot program status comparison between robot and file server

## Overview
The Robot Program Handler was developed as part of the Robosonic Project (Part of the 2nd [DIHÂ²](http://www.dih-squared.eu/) funding project). Developed by [RoWa Automation GmBh](https://www.rowa-automation.at/)

## Architecture

*The whole picture shows the scope of the entire Robosonic project. The red square shows the components of the Robot Program Handler.*

Basically, the Program Handler consists of 3 software components:
  - Robot Program Handler - Server
  - Robot Program Handler - Client
  - File Server

### Robot Program Handler - Server
Is a software written in C++ that is based on the OpenSource [C3bridge-server](https://github.com/ulsu-tech/c3bridge-server).
The software itself has to be installed directly on the robot and .here it takes over the functions for sending and receiving robot programs.

### Robot Program Handler - Client
The robot program handler - client serves as a communication bridge between the individual components.
The interface to the OCB was realised via a specially developed API. The communication between client and server is done over TCP/IP. Furthermore, the client takes over the program transfer between file server and robot.

### File Server
The file server is used to make robot programs available to several processing centres.
